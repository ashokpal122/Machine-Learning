The sizzling mexicana comes with a cheese patty is the most right combination that makes you doubt you're own marriage.

It was a nice experience.\\\\n\\\\nFOOD, TASTE, AND QUALITY:\\\\n\\\\nWe had the English Mustard Fish Burger and D'hide Vegetarian Pizza. The pizza base was not made of in-house fresh dough and it was a readymade thin-crust base which didn't add any much excitement. The toppings were although good and it had mushtooms, broccoli, sweetcorn, bell peppers, and sun dried tomatoes. So, a thumbs down for the pizza base but the toppings were really good.\\\\n\\\\nThe mustard fish burger was quite good. It was big and filled with fresh mustard fish, lettuce, and sauces.
